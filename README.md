# The Slap 
Welcome to The Slap's repository. The Slap is a fictional social media introduced by Nickelodeon in its TV Show, Victorious. The current repository is an attempt to breathe life into this website that sweetened my childhood while, at the same time, learning a lot from this coding experience. It is openly inspired from the original website created by Nickelodeon, which was made functional by me. All assets belong to Nickelodeon and Viacom. The original website can be encountered [here.](http://web.archive.org/web/20120110121312/http://www.theslap.com/) 
## Main features 
Built using (HTML and CSS), PHP and JavaScript and including a SQL database, this project was solely made for fun and helped me improve my JavaScript skills, essentially. It includes the following features: 
- Ability to create an account with unique profile page (profile picture, banner, favourite music thanks to the inclusion of Spotify's API). 
- An inclusion of SMTP to handle validation email, as well as password reset. 
- Possibility to publish statuses with text, moods and pictures. Kindly note that the media option is currently unavailable due to some technical issues that will be fixed promptly. 
- Great interaction with other users (following other people, liking their post, making them part of the most popular users). 
- A chatting functionality that was put in standby for the moment.
